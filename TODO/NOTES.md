### Global LLM

Is it standard to use a global variable (like llm) for a resource like an ML model in an API?

Short Answer:
Yes, it's a common and often pragmatic approach, especially for resources that are:

Expensive to initialize: Loading a large language model is a perfect example. You only want to do this once when the application starts.

Meant to be a singleton: You typically only need one instance of the loaded model serving all requests.

Read-only after initialization (mostly): The llm object itself isn't frequently modified by request handlers (though its internal state might change during inference).

FastAPI's lifespan context manager (which you are using correctly) is specifically designed to manage such global resources, ensuring they are initialized at startup and cleaned up at shutdown.

Longer Answer with Nuances:

Why it's done (Pros):

Efficiency: Avoids reloading the model on every request, which would be incredibly slow and resource-intensive.

Simplicity: Easy to access the model from any request handler (global llm).

FastAPI's Design: The lifespan events are the idiomatic way in FastAPI to manage application-level state that needs to be available throughout the app's lifecycle.

State Management: For resources like an ML model, connection pools (e.g., to a database), or external service clients, having a single, globally accessible instance managed by the application's lifecycle is standard.

Potential Downsides of Globals (and how FastAPI mitigates them):

Testability: Globals can sometimes make unit testing harder because components become tightly coupled to the global state.

Mitigation: FastAPI's dependency injection system can help here. While you're directly using the global llm, for more complex scenarios or for easier testing, you could wrap the LLM access in a dependency function. This allows you to mock or override the dependency during tests.

Namespace Pollution: Too many globals can clutter the namespace.

Mitigation: For one or two critical resources like an ML model, this is generally acceptable. If you had many, you might group them into a shared state object or use a more structured dependency injection approach.

Concurrency Issues (if the global is mutable and not thread-safe): If multiple requests were trying to modify the llm object itself in a non-thread-safe way, you'd have problems.

Mitigation:

llama-cpp-python's Llama object is generally designed to handle concurrent inference requests (often by internal locking or by being stateless for individual calls to create_chat_completion once loaded).

Your create_chat_completion function uses loop.run_in_executor for the blocking llm.create_chat_completion call. This moves the CPU-bound LLM work to a separate thread pool, preventing it from blocking FastAPI's async event loop. This is crucial for handling concurrent requests efficiently.

Alternatives (and why they might be overkill here):

Dependency Injection for Everything:
You could pass the llm instance explicitly through FastAPI's dependency injection to every endpoint that needs it.

# Example of more explicit DI (conceptual)
def get_llm_instance():
    if llm is None:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=503, detail="LLM not loaded")
    return llm

@app.post("/v1/chat/completions")
async def create_chat_completion(request: ChatCompletionRequest, current_llm: Llama = Depends(get_llm_instance)):
    # use current_llm instead of global llm
    ...


Benefit: Better for testing, makes dependencies explicit.

Downside: Slightly more verbose for a resource that's truly global and initialized once. The lifespan approach is cleaner for this specific "load once, use many times" pattern.

Storing on app.state:
FastAPI allows you to store arbitrary state on the app instance itself:

# In lifespan startup
app.state.llm_model = Llama(...)

# In endpoint
@app.post("/v1/chat/completions")
async def create_chat_completion(request: Request): # FastAPI Request object
    current_llm = request.app.state.llm_model
    ...

Benefit: Avoids explicit global keyword, keeps state tied to the app instance.

Downside: Still effectively global state. Slightly more verbose to access (request.app.state.llm_model). The lifespan with a module-level global is often considered just as clear for this specific use case.

Conclusion:

Your current approach using a module-level global variable llm initialized within the lifespan context manager is a standard, idiomatic, and perfectly acceptable way to handle an expensive-to-load, singleton resource like your Llama model in a FastAPI application.

It balances efficiency, simplicity, and leverages FastAPI's intended mechanisms for lifecycle management. The key is that the initialization and cleanup are well-defined within the lifespan, and the resource itself (Llama object) is suitable for concurrent access as managed by llama-cpp-python and your use of run_in_executor.

So, no need to feel that using this global is "non-standard" or "bad practice" in this specific context. It's a common pattern for good reasons.



### AWAIT run in executor

This line of code is a key pattern for integrating synchronous (blocking) code into an asynchronous (async/await) Python application, especially in frameworks like FastAPI that are built on asyncio.

Let's break down completion = await loop.run_in_executor(None, func_to_run_in_executor):

asyncio.get_event_loop() and loop:

loop = asyncio.get_event_loop(): This line (which typically precedes the one you asked about) retrieves the current asyncio event loop. The event loop is the heart of an asyncio application; it manages and executes asynchronous tasks (coroutines).

loop.run_in_executor(executor, func, *args):

This is a method of the asyncio event loop. Its purpose is to run a regular synchronous function (func) in a separate thread (or process, depending on the executor) without blocking the main event loop.

executor:

This argument specifies the executor to use. An executor is an object that manages a pool of threads or processes.

If executor is None (as in your case: loop.run_in_executor(None, ...)), asyncio uses its default thread pool executor (concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor). This executor maintains a pool of worker threads.

func:

This is the synchronous (blocking) function you want to execute. In your code, func_to_run_in_executor is this function. It was created using functools.partial to pre-fill arguments for llm.create_chat_completion.

*args:

Any additional positional arguments to pass to func. In your case, these arguments are already bound to func_to_run_in_executor by functools.partial.

func_to_run_in_executor:

This was created earlier:

func_to_run_in_executor = functools.partial(
    llm.create_chat_completion, # The blocking function
    messages=messages_for_llm,  # Arguments for it
    temperature=request.temperature,
    max_tokens=request.max_tokens,
    top_p=request.top_p,
    stop=request.stop,
)


llm.create_chat_completion is a synchronous method from llama-cpp-python. Calling it directly in an async def function would block the entire event loop, preventing FastAPI from handling any other concurrent requests until the LLM call finishes (which can take seconds).

How it Achieves Asynchronicity:

When loop.run_in_executor(None, func_to_run_in_executor) is called:

The event loop takes func_to_run_in_executor.

It submits this function to one of the threads in its default ThreadPoolExecutor.

The worker thread then executes func_to_run_in_executor (which in turn calls llm.create_chat_completion(...)). This execution happens in parallel with the event loop.

The event loop itself is not blocked. It can continue processing other tasks, like handling new incoming HTTP requests, I/O operations, etc.

await:

loop.run_in_executor(...) returns an asyncio.Future object (which is awaitable).

The await keyword in completion = await loop.run_in_executor(...) tells asyncio:

"Pause the execution of the current coroutine (create_chat_completion async def function) here."

"Yield control back to the event loop so it can do other work."

"Resume this coroutine only when the Future (representing the execution of func_to_run_in_executor in the separate thread) is complete and has a result (or an exception)."

completion = ...:

Once the worker thread finishes executing func_to_run_in_executor and llm.create_chat_completion returns its result, the Future completes.

The event loop then schedules the create_chat_completion coroutine to resume.

The result returned by func_to_run_in_executor (which is the output of llm.create_chat_completion) is then assigned to the completion variable.

If func_to_run_in_executor raised an exception in the worker thread, that exception would be re-raised at the await point in the main coroutine.

Why is this important for your FastAPI LLM app?

Responsiveness: FastAPI is an asynchronous web framework. Its main selling point is its ability to handle many concurrent connections efficiently without needing many threads or processes, primarily by not blocking on I/O.

CPU-Bound Work: LLM inference (llm.create_chat_completion) is a CPU-bound (and potentially GPU-bound) operation. It's not I/O-bound. If you call it directly in an async function, it will monopolize the single thread running the event loop, making your entire application unresponsive to other requests.

Solution: run_in_executor offloads this blocking, CPU-bound work to a separate thread from a thread pool. This allows the main event loop to stay free and responsive, handling new incoming requests, managing network connections, and performing other asyncio-friendly tasks while the LLM crunches numbers in a background thread.

In essence, await loop.run_in_executor(...) is the bridge that allows your asyncio-based FastAPI application to correctly and efficiently interact with synchronous, blocking libraries or CPU-intensive functions like those from llama-cpp-python.


### Yield loop

You've correctly identified the key aspects in your docstring's Yields: section!

Let's clarify and provide the precise type hint:

What does it yield?

The yield statement in an asynccontextmanager (or a regular contextmanager) is what separates the "setup" phase from the "teardown" phase.

The value that is yielded becomes the result of the async with statement (or with statement for synchronous context managers) if the as keyword is used.

In your specific lifespan function:

yield  # FastAPI application starts serving requests after this point


Since you are just yielding without an explicit value, it implicitly yields None.

What would the function return when type hinting it?

A function decorated with @asynccontextmanager is an asynchronous generator function.

When called, it returns an asynchronous generator object.

This generator object is what FastAPI uses to manage the setup and teardown.

The type hint for an asynchronous generator that yields None and doesn't receive any values via send() is:

AsyncGenerator[None, None]

Let's break this down:

AsyncGenerator: Indicates it's an asynchronous generator.

[YieldType, SendType]: The generic parameters for AsyncGenerator.

YieldType: The type of the value that is yielded by the generator. In your case, since yield is used without a value, it's None.

SendType: The type of the value that can be sent into the generator using agen.asend(value). In the context of FastAPI's lifespan, nothing is sent into it, so this is also None.

So, the fully type-hinted function signature would be:

from typing import AsyncGenerator, Optional # Make sure to import AsyncGenerator
from fastapi import FastAPI
# ... other imports ...
# llm: Optional[Llama] = None # Assuming Llama is your model type

@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI) -> AsyncGenerator[None, None]:
    """
    Manages the lifecycle of the LLM application.

    # ... (rest of your excellent docstring) ...

    Args:
        app (FastAPI): The FastAPI application instance (passed automatically).

    Yields:
        None: The context manager yields control to the FastAPI application
              to start serving requests after the LLM is loaded.
    """
    global llm
    # ... (startup code) ...

    yield # This yields None

    # ... (shutdown code) ...
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_START
content_copy
download
Use code with caution.
Python
IGNORE_WHEN_COPYING_END

In summary:

It yields: None (implicitly, because yield is used without a value).

Function return type hint: AsyncGenerator[None, None]

Your existing docstring correctly states "Yields: None", which is accurate for what the async with block would receive if it used as some_variable. The type hint AsyncGenerator[None, None] just formalizes this from the perspective of what the lifespan function itself returns (an async generator object).
